how to make portfolio via Github?
ChatGPT said:
Creating a portfolio on GitHub is a great idea—it’s free, professional, and easy to showcase your projects. Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored for someone building a personal portfolio:
1. Set Up Your GitHub Account
If you don’t already have an account, sign up here.
Make sure your username looks professional (e.g., xuanbin-li).
2. Create a New Repository for Your Portfolio
Click “New” under Repositories.
Name it: username.github.io (replace username with your GitHub username).
Example: xuanbin-li.github.io
Set it to Public.
Check “Initialize this repository with a README”.
This special naming (username.github.io) enables GitHub Pages to host your portfolio.
3. Build Your Portfolio Website
You have a few options:
Option A: Use a Pre-built Template
Go to GitHub Pages themes or search for free HTML/CSS/JS portfolio templates on GitHub.
Clone the repository to your computer using Git:
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
Customize the template with your name, projects, and contact info.
Option B: Build From Scratch
Create an index.html file in the repository.
Add basic sections:
About Me
Projects (with links to GitHub repos)
Skills / Tech Stack
Contact Info
Optional: Add CSS for styling or use frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
4. Upload Your Website to GitHub
Commit your files:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup"
git push origin main
Go to Settings → Pages in your repository.
Set the source to main branch → / (root).
After a few minutes, your portfolio will be live at:
https://username.github.io
5. Showcase Your Projects
Link each project to its GitHub repo.
Include a short description, tech stack, and screenshot or demo link.
Optional: Use Markdown in README.md files for each project to make them look professional.
6. Optional Enhancements
Use a custom domain (www.yourname.com) via GitHub Pages.
Add animations, responsive design, or light/dark mode.
Include a downloadable resume link.
Add badges for skills (e.g., Python, R, TensorFlow).
If you want, I can create a simple ready-to-use GitHub portfolio template for you with sections for your projects, skills, and contact info—so you just need to upload it.
Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Uploaded image
I need to write my portfolio like this format, can you concise when I upload the report?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — I can absolutely help with that. 👍
Once you upload your report (PDF, DOCX, or text file), I can:

Read it carefully,
Extract the key project info (title, dataset, methods, results, etc.), and
Rewrite it in the same concise Markdown format as the example you showed, like this:
# [Project 1: Your Project Title](GitHub or report link)
Brief description of what you did and why.

* Dataset: short description
* Methods/Algorithms: key models or techniques used
* Tools: Python, R, TensorFlow, etc.
* Key Results or Achievements
* [Project Report](link) or [GitHub Repo](link)
Please upload your report file now, and I’ll condense it into this clean portfolio style.
ChatGPT said:
Here’s your project rewritten concisely in the same Markdown portfolio format as the example you showed:
# [Project 1: Superstore Sales Performance Analysis & Forecasting](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Superstore-Analysis)
This project analyzed a global superstore dataset (2011–2014) using R to explore business performance and forecast future sales and profit trends.

* **Dataset:** Superstore dataset from Kaggle (2011–2014), containing sales, profit, discounts, and shipping details across multiple regions and categories.  
* **Tools:** R (tidyverse, forecast, corrplot, treemap, data.table)  
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization (bar, pie, scatter, box, treemap), correlation analysis, and ARIMA time series forecasting.  
* **Key Insights:**  
  - APAC market and Central region achieved the highest sales and profit.  
  - "Phones" under *Technology* had the highest sales, while *Tables* incurred losses.  
  - Profit negatively correlated with Discount.  
  - ARIMA forecast predicted a continued increase in 2015 sales and profit.  
* **Result:** Provided data-driven insights into regional and category-level performance and built an ARIMA model for forecasting next-year trends.  

Would you like me to make it ready for your GitHub portfolio README, including formatting (headers, links, and optional images placeholders)?
I can also help you create a second version with your name and team info (e.g., “Group Project – Northeastern University”).
You said:
I also want to upload some related pictures
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — adding visuals is a great idea 👏 It makes your GitHub portfolio much more engaging and shows your data visualization skills.
Here’s how you can include pictures (plots, charts, or screenshots) in your portfolio repo and Markdown file:

🧭 Step-by-Step: Adding Pictures to Your GitHub Portfolio
1. Prepare Your Images
Save your visualizations (plots, dashboards, screenshots) as .png or .jpg.
Give them clear names, e.g.:
sales_by_region.png
arima_forecast.png
correlation_plot.png
treemap.png
2. Upload to Your GitHub Repository
Go to your GitHub repo (e.g., Superstore-Analysis).
Click Add file → Upload files.
Upload your image files into a folder (recommended name: images/).
Example repo structure:
Superstore-Analysis/
├── README.md
├── superstore_analysis.R
└── images/
    ├── sales_by_region.png
    ├── arima_forecast.png
    ├── correlation_plot.png
    └── treemap.png
3. Add Images in Your README (Portfolio)
In your Markdown file, insert pictures like this:
# [Project 1: Superstore Sales Performance Analysis & Forecasting](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Superstore-Analysis)

This project analyzed a global superstore dataset (2011–2014) using R to explore business performance and forecast future sales and profit trends.

* **Dataset:** Superstore dataset from Kaggle (2011–2014)
* **Tools:** R (tidyverse, forecast, corrplot, treemap, data.table)
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization, correlation analysis, and ARIMA forecasting.

* **Key Insights:**
  - APAC market and Central region achieved the highest sales and profit.
  - “Phones” had the highest sales, “Tables” showed losses.
  - ARIMA model predicted growth in 2015.

Would you like me to help you design a ready-to-upload README.md file (with placeholders for your actual image names)?
If you upload 2–4 of your favorite plots, I can insert them directly into a Markdown template for you.
You said:
Uploaded image
it doesn't show the pictures
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see what’s happening 👍 — your Markdown image syntax is almost correct, but there are two common issues causing GitHub not to render the pictures properly:
✅ Fix 1: Correct Markdown Syntax
Make sure you have a space after the exclamation mark and no extra brackets around the image path.
Instead of this ❌:
![](images/ARIMA forecast for Profit.png)
Write this ✅:
![ARIMA Forecast for Next Year (Profit)](images/ARIMA%20forecast%20for%20Profit.png)
![ARIMA Forecast for Next Year (Sales)](images/ARIMA%20forecast%20for%20Sales.png)
The key detail: GitHub URLs don’t handle spaces directly — you must replace spaces with %20.
✅ Fix 2: Check File Location
Confirm the images are in a folder named images/ in the same directory as your README.md.
It should look like this:
Superstore-Analysis/
├── README.md
└── images/
    ├── ARIMA forecast for Profit.png
    └── ARIMA forecast for Sales.png
✅ Fix 3: Rename Files (Recommended)
To avoid issues, rename the files using underscores or hyphens instead of spaces:
ARIMA_forecast_Profit.png
ARIMA_forecast_Sales.png
Then update your Markdown:
![ARIMA Forecast for Next Year (Profit)](images/ARIMA_forecast_Profit.png)
![ARIMA Forecast for Next Year (Sales)](images/ARIMA_forecast_Sales.png)
If you’d like, I can rewrite your entire README section with the correct syntax for all images (using underscores and consistent captions).
Would you like me to do that?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — based on your ALY6010 Final Project Report, here’s a concise, GitHub-ready portfolio entry written in the same Markdown format as the example you showed earlier (clean, readable, and ready for images too):
# [Project 2: Beijing Housing Price Analysis & Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Beijing-Housing-Price-Analysis)

This project analyzes housing prices in Beijing using R. The goal was to understand key factors influencing house prices and test hypotheses about housing market trends between 2016 and 2017.

* **Dataset:** Housing Price in Beijing dataset from Kaggle (318,851 observations, 26 features).
* **Tools:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, corrplot, dplyr, stats).
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, correlation plots), and hypothesis testing (one-sample and two-sample t-tests).
* **Key Insights:**
  - Total price strongly correlated with house area, community average, and number of rooms.
  - Houses near subways or with elevators tend to have higher average prices.
  - “Bungalows” are the most expensive building type, while “Towers” are more affordable.
  - Average housing prices increased significantly from 2016 to 2017.
* **Result:** Provided data-driven insights into how structural and locational factors affect housing prices in Beijing and validated findings through statistical hypothesis testing.

![Scatter Plot 2](images/scatter_price_totalprice_bygroup.png)

**Average Monthly Housing Price**
![Average Price by Month](images/avg_price_by_month.png)
✅ To Make It Work
Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., Beijing-Housing-Price-Analysis).
Add your R script(s) and this README.md.
Create an images/ folder in the repo and upload your plots with the same names (or rename in Markdown to match your files).
Would you like me to include your hypothesis testing results (like t-values and conclusions) as a short “Results Table” section in the Markdown too?
That would make it look even more polished and professional.
You said:
我希望能在大标题前面加一个可以使对应部分内容隐藏的
