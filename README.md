This project analyzed a global superstore dataset (2011‚Äì2014) using R to explore business performance and forecast future sales and profit trends.

* **Dataset:** Superstore dataset from Kaggle (2011‚Äì2014), containing sales, profit, discounts, and shipping details across multiple regions and categories.  
* **Tools:** R (tidyverse, forecast, corrplot, treemap, data.table)  
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization (bar, pie, scatter, box, treemap), correlation analysis, and ARIMA time series forecasting.  
* **Key Insights:**  
  - APAC market and Central region achieved the highest sales and profit.  
  - "Phones" under *Technology* had the highest sales, while *Tables* incurred losses.  
  - Profit negatively correlated with Discount.  
  - ARIMA forecast predicted a continued increase in 2015 sales and profit.  
* **Result:** Provided data-driven insights into regional and category-level performance and built an ARIMA model for forecasting next-year trends.

This project analyzes housing prices in Beijing using R. The goal was to understand key factors influencing house prices and test hypotheses about housing market trends between 2016 and 2017.

* **Dataset:** Housing Price in Beijing dataset from Kaggle (318,851 observations, 26 features).
* **Tools:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, corrplot, dplyr, stats).
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, correlation plots), and hypothesis testing (one-sample and two-sample t-tests).
* **Key Insights:**
  - Total price strongly correlated with house area, community average, and number of rooms.
  - Houses near subways or with elevators tend to have higher average prices.
  - ‚ÄúBungalows‚Äù are the most expensive building type, while ‚ÄúTowers‚Äù are more affordable.
  - Average housing prices increased significantly from 2016 to 2017.
* **Result:** Provided data-driven insights into how structural and locational factors affect housing prices in Beijing and validated findings through statistical hypothesis testing.
