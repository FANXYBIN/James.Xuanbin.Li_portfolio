  - **Temperature (15 – 30 °C)** positively affects rentals; **rainfall, humidity, and wind speed** reduce them.  
  - **Summer** records the highest rental activity, followed by spring and autumn.  
* **Models Evaluated:**  
  - **SVM:** Accuracy = 78.99%, Precision = 77.67%, Recall = 78.99%, F1 = 77.93%.  
  - **Gradient Boosting:** Accuracy = 79.83%, F1 = 79.20%.  
  - **Random Forest:** Accuracy = 80.02%, F1 = 79.50%.  
  - **Multiple Linear Regression:** R² = 0.473, F-statistic = 609.8 (significant predictors: hour, temperature, humidity, rainfall).  
* **Insights & Recommendations:**  
  - Use forecasts to rebalance bikes before morning/evening peaks.  
  - Adjust staffing and offer promotions during poor-weather periods.  
  - Promote biking events in warm seasons to leverage natural demand growth.

### 🧱 Model Creation

**1. Dataset Upload**
- Uploaded the CSV dataset to **Vertex AI Datasets** in Google Cloud Storage.  
- Automatically parsed schema with columns such as:
  - `Post_frequency`, `Social_event_attendance`, `Stage_fear`, `Friends_circle_size`, `Time_spent_alone`, `Stress_level`.  
- Labeled the **target column**: `Personality` → *Introvert* or *Extrovert*.  

**2. AutoML Training**
- Used **Vertex AI AutoML Classification** (no-code training).  
- Enabled automatic feature engineering and model tuning.  
- Ran multiple experiments with two confidence thresholds:
  - **0.5** (balanced accuracy vs. coverage)
  - **0.8** (higher precision, lower recall)

**3. Model Evaluation**
- Vertex AI generated precision–recall and confusion matrix visualizations.  
- **Best model:** 0.5 threshold → optimal for user-friendly applications.  
- **Results:**
  - Accuracy: **93–94%**
  - Introvert recall improved from **93% → 94%**
  - Reduced false positives (Introverts misclassified as Extroverts) from **7% → 6%**

- Removed redundant columns, standardized field names, and validated schema consistency.  
- Generated seven cleaned datasets:
  - `fact_facebook`, `fact_instagram`, `fact_linkedin`, `fact_pinterest`, `fact_twitter`, `fact_gmb`, and `dim_post`.  

**2. Data Cleaning**
- Filled missing values using median imputation.  
- Dropped columns with >80% missing values.  
- Flagged residual errors for manual review.

**3. EDA**
- **Instagram:** Engagement, followers, impressions, and reach were strongly correlated.  
- **Twitter(X):** Clear anomaly clusters in July 2024 and January 2024; engagement spikes >850 followed by steep declines.  
- **Pinterest:** Lower but stable engagement patterns.  
- **Facebook:** High variance and isolated outlier peaks.  
- **LinkedIn:** Consistent moderate engagement rate and audience growth.

---

### 🔎 Post-Perspective Analytics

**KPI Formulas**
- *Engagement Rate* = Engagement ÷ Reach  
- *Like Rate* = Likes ÷ Reach  
- *Impressions per User* = Impressions ÷ Reach  

**Insights**
- Instagram and LinkedIn maintain consistent engagement and like rates.  
- Facebook occasionally yields top-performing viral posts.  
- Twitter(X) and Pinterest show wider metric dispersion, indicating platform volatility.  
- Facebook: strong re-exposure → brand recall;  
  Instagram + LinkedIn: balanced delivery;  
  Twitter + Pinterest: strong user acquisition but lower retention.
