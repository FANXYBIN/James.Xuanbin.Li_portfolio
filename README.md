### [Project 1: Superstore Sales Performance Analysis & Forecasting](https://github.com/FANXYBIN/Project1_Superstore_Dataset)

This project analyzed a global superstore dataset (2011–2014) using R to explore business performance and forecast future sales and profit trends.

* **Dataset:** Superstore dataset from Kaggle (2011–2014), containing sales, profit, discounts, and shipping details across multiple regions and categories.  
* **Tools:** R (tidyverse, forecast, corrplot, treemap, data.table)  
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization (bar, pie, scatter, box, treemap), correlation analysis, and ARIMA time series forecasting.  
* **Key Insights:**  
  - APAC market and Central region achieved the highest sales and profit.  
  - “Phones” under *Technology* had the highest sales, while *Tables* incurred losses.  
  - Profit negatively correlated with Discount.  
  - ARIMA forecast predicted a continued increase in 2015 sales and profit.

### [Project 2: Beijing Housing Price Analysis & Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/FANXYBIN/Project2_Beijing_Housing_Price_Dataset)

This project analyzes housing prices in Beijing using R. The goal was to understand key factors influencing house prices and test hypotheses about housing market trends between 2016 and 2017.

* **Dataset:** Housing Price in Beijing dataset from Kaggle (318,851 observations, 26 features).  
* **Tools:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, corrplot, dplyr, stats).  
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, correlation plots), and hypothesis testing (one-sample and two-sample t-tests).  
* **Key Insights:**  
  - Total price strongly correlated with house area, community average, and number of rooms.  
  - Houses near subways or with elevators tend to have higher average prices.  
  - “Bungalows” are the most expensive building type, while “Towers” are more affordable.  
  - Average housing prices increased significantly from 2016 to 2017.
